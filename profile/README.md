[AFFCTIV](https://affctiv.ai) actively engages in numerous creative projects, consistently producing high-quality research without compromise. We are inclusive and welcome individuals from all backgrounds to share in our work by accessing open-source codes. Furthermore, we embrace flexibility toward new ideas and shifts in focus.


AFFCTIV's motto, or lab values, is "Pokemon." We utilize this motto to encapsulate our core values and what we prioritize.

We recognize that our values represent ideals. While we acknowledge our imperfections, we are committed to growing and embodying these values. We aspire to become the ideal Pokémon.
